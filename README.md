# Wingmate

Wingmate is chrome extension that allows users to use chatGPT as they browse, interacting directly with their current viewing page.

## Setup
- run **npm run build**
- import generated **build** folder to local chrome extensions inside browser
- grab you own API key from their website and put as **REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY** in .env
- For now this will work best for text based pages: like blogs, news, articles etc
